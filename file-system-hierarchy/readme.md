This section covers the structure and purpose of essential directories in a Linux system.

## 🗂️ Key Directories

| Directory | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `/`      | Root of the entire file system. |
| `/home`  | Contains personal directories for users. |
| `/etc`   | System-wide configuration files. |
| `/bin`   | Essential binary executables (like `ls`, `cp`). |
| `/usr`   | User programs, libraries, documentation. |
| `/var`   | Variable data such as logs, mail, spools. |
| `/tmp`   | Temporary files, often cleared on reboot. |
| `/dev`   | Device files representing hardware. |
| `/proc`  | Virtual filesystem with process and kernel info. |
| `/lib`   | Shared libraries used by system programs. |
| `/opt`   | Optional and third-party application software. |

## 🧠 Notes

> ✅ **`/etc`** is commonly used for editing system and service configuration files.  
> ✅ **`/proc`** and **`/sys`** are **virtual filesystems** generated by the kernel — they reflect real-time system info.  
> ✅ **`/var/log`** contains important log files for troubleshooting and monitoring system behavior.
